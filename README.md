# üëã Greetings! Khushi here, 

I am a final-year undergraduate student and an ardent enthusiast of Machine Learning, Data Science, and Artificial Intelligence. üíªüî¨

My research interests lie in NLP and Deep Learning. üìöüß† With a solid programming and analytical foundation, I leverage cutting-edge tools to tackle complex problems

üöÄüîç Driven by excellence, I thrive in collaborative environments fostering mutual learning. ü§ùüåü Let's embark on an exciting journey where creativity meets technical prowess, redefining boundaries in AI. üí™üöÄ


## Technical Proficiencies

In terms of languages, I'm proficient in Python, C/C++, and SQL.

For Natural Language Processing (NLP), I have experience with NLTK, LSTM, Transformers, and Named Entity Recognition.

In the realm of computer vision, I'm skilled in using OpenCV, Tensorflow, PyTorch, YOLO for object detection, and MediaPipe.

When it comes to data analytics and science, I'm well-versed in statistics, NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, BeautifulSoup, and Plotly.

I also have experience with databases and other tools such as Git, Firebase, MySQL, PostGreSQL, and various web technologies including Flask and Django.



## Work Experience

### Data Science Intern at BroaderAI IT Solutions | Jul '23 - May '24

During my tenure, I spearheaded website backend development and transitioned to machine learning projects using OpenCV. This included initiatives such as document scanning, mango leaf disease detection, and object recognition. I managed efficient data extraction using pdfplumber, contributing to a text-to-speech conversion project. Demonstrated expertise in computer vision by utilizing YOLO and MediaPipe, significantly impacting innovative project development.

### Academic Research on Cross-Cultural Multilingual Sarcasm Analysis in Indian Dialects | Sep '23 - Present

Collaborating with fellow researcher Raval Meet and under the guidance of Dr. Mitali Desai, I'm actively involved in refining and optimizing the implementation of natural language processing (NLP) models and techniques. Our goal is to identify and analyze sarcastic language in various Indian regional dialects, aiming for increased accuracy and robustness in multilingual sarcasm detection.
